## design of a lightweight learning management system

Most content will be statically-generated thru emacs, org-mode, make,
etc.  And I'll use subversion for code exchange.  But there are a few
things I want a server to do...

* Account management
  For setting up authentication and authorization for HTTP generally
  as well as Subversion.  Allow users to set/modify/reset their own
  passwords using validated email addresses.

*** need to try out postgres HTTP auth first

*** can apache provide custom 401 page? with reset link?
*** possible for django app to get username from HTTP auth?

***** Initial server response
HTTP/1.1 401 Authorization Required
Server: HTTPd/1.0
Date: Sat, 27 Nov 2004 10:18:15 GMT
WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm="Secure Area"
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 311

<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN"
 "http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-html401-19991224/loose.dtd">
<HTML>
  <HEAD>
    <TITLE>Error</TITLE>
    <META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1">
  </HEAD>
  <BODY><H1>401 Unauthorized.</H1></BODY>
</HTML>

***** Client re-request, user "Aladdin" password "open sesame"
GET /private/index.html HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
Authorization: Basic QWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuIHNlc2FtZQ==

where base64("Aladdin:open sesame") == "QWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuIHNlc2FtZQ=="

So it should be possible to grab that header?

***** Digest auth possible, but not needed with SSL

***** Might want to re-auth with cookies before gradebook access

* Grade keeping
  So that students can check their grades.  Ideally MY interface to it
  will not be web-based, but rather just an ODS file.  The program can
  read the ODS (or perhaps exported CSV) and present that info to
  authenticated students.

* Submission (for courses not primarily using subversion)
  Authenticated students can upload files to store into
  subversion. Ideally will handle single or multiple files, can
  enforce filenames, etc.
